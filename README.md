## Appendix

### Features

- **Add Products to Cart**: Users can browse the product catalog and add products to their shopping cart. The cart is updated dynamically using React and Redux for state management.
  
- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to their accounts. This is secured with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication, allowing users to access personalized features like order history or saved cart items.
  
- **Search Functionality**: Implemented a product search feature to help users quickly find products based on keywords, categories, or price ranges. The search results are dynamically displayed as users type in the search bar.

- **Routing Between Pages**: The app uses **React Router** to navigate between different pages such as the home page, product detail page, cart page, and user login/signup pages.

- **Redux for State Management**: Redux is used to manage the global state of the application, including cart items, user authentication status, and product information. This allows seamless data flow across different components and pages.

### Project Background

This project was developed as part of my **5th semester diploma work** for learning **full-stack development**. I first created the **front-end** with React to showcase product listings, cart functionalities, and user interactions. Then, I focused on learning **back-end development**, where I used **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** to handle user authentication, product management, and storing orders. The application is deployed on **Netlify** for the front-end and **Railway.app** for the back-end.

 
### Known Issues

- There are occasional delays in loading product images on slower connections. We're working on optimizing this.
  
- Some mobile users have reported difficulties logging out. A fix will be rolled out soon.
